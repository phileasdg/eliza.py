### eliza.py, ELIZA in Python

This is a little version of ELIZA, a famous natural-language AI demo from the 1960s,
packaged up as a Python module.  It's all smoke and mirrors; the program doesn't
have a clue what it is saying and it's not difficult to catch it out, but it's amusing
and it means your chatbot always has something to say.
